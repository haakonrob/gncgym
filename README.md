## Installation

Navigate to the folder in your favourite terminal and use pip to install the package. I recommend the following:

```bash
cd gncgym
pip install -e .
```

This installs the package, but doesn't cache the files so you can continue editing the project (this project is by no means finished).

You can then run `gncgym play` in the terminal to start up the player-controllable default simulation.
